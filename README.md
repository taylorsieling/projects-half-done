# Projects Half Done

## Description

Projects Half Done is a Sinatra application made for my Flatiron School portfolio. Projects Half Done allows users to create and save knitting or other fiber arts projects. A user can also create hanks of yarn and associate them with their created projects. 

Projects have a name, category, knit time, and status (not started, in progress, completed). Yarn has a brand, name, color, weight, and quantity. Yarn can be associated with a project, or saved to be added to a project at a later date.

## Install Instructions

1. Fork and Clone
2. Bundle Install
3. Run rake db:migrate to set up a database
4. Run shotgun to start a local server

## How to Use the Application

- Create an account
- Create a project, or many projects!
- Add your hanks of yarn; Yarn can be associated with a project, or saved to add to a project later.
- Your projects and hanks of yarn can updated or deleted at any time.
